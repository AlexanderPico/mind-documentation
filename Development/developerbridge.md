# Developer Bridge

The Developer Bridge is your "dashboard" where you can build and test HEXA skills.

Here's what the Developer Bridge looks like when you first log in. Any announcements will be displayed on the home page, and you will notice there are two sections: [Skill](/Development/bridgeskill.md) and [Test Skill](/Development/bridgetestskill.md). 

From the Developer Bridge, you can upload your packages to the [Skill Store](/Introduction/skillstore.md), test them out, and add details and description. You can also customize your [profile](/Development/bridgeprofile.md).
