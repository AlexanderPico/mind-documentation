# Your First Skill

Are you ready to build your first skill on HEXA? This first example shows how to use the `mind` CLI to build, package, and run a Skill on HEXA. Then we'll talk about how to make HEXA walk and use sensors in the [SensorWalkSkill tutorial](/Development/sensorwalktutorial.md).

## Create a new project

To start running Skills on our HEXA, we can use `mind init projectname` to build an example skeleton project. Let's do that now:

```
$ mind init helloworld
$ cd helloworld
```

## Build and package

Well, our Skill doesn't really do anything right now. But that's okay. We should probably test that we can build and package it correctly, and get it sent to our HEXA robot. We'll go into how to make your first skill in this [tutorial](/Development/yourfirstskill.md).
