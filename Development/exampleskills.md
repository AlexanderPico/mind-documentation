# Example Skills

You can find our example skills on [GitHub](/Introduction/github.md), and each of them are described here.

* **SensorWalkSkill** - SensorWalkSkill makes the HEXA to walk forward and change direction when encountering obstacles. We go through the details of developing this skill in our [Tutorial](/Development/sensorwalktutorial.md).
* **MoveLegsSkill** - MoveLegsSkill makes the HEXA to move its front right leg up and down and front left leg in a circle. This will help you reference different ways you can move HEXA's joints and limbs.
* **BalanceSkill** - BalanceSkill makes the HEXA keep its balance when standing on an unstable surface. You could also try to hold the HEXA’s feet with your hands.
* **SightSkill - **SightSkill makes the HEXA react to what’s in front of it by comparing images captured from the camera.
* **PeripheralsSkill - **PeripheralsSkill implements a skill that shows how to use the peripherals interface.
* **OpenCVSkill - **OpenCVSkill is an example project showing how to cross-compile C++ libraries and bind them to Golang for Skill development. This Skill makes the HEXA stand up when it detects human faces.
* **ROSSkill - **ROSSkill implements a Skill that shows how to publish images to an ROS topic via rosserial.

# Extending the SDK

While we've gone through some simple examples so far, that's only the tip of the iceberg on what HEXA can do. We'll be showing off advanced use cases here that bring in other packages or libraries to make something truly unique.

Our first advanced tutorial goes over how to use OpenCV with HEXA.
