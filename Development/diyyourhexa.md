# DIY your HEXA
We're sharing three 3D model files for HEXA, including its head shell, part of its leg and its toe.

With these model files, you can now customize and create your own HEXA shell, or make add-ons such as a go-pro platform using the 4 support points inside the head shell. With the 3D model of HEXA's leg and toe, you can now more easily create add-ons for HEXA such as a pen-holder for its feet. In addition, you will be able to optimize HEXA for different terrain surfaces by customizing its toes.
