# Using the HEXA Simulator

We provide a 3D [HEXA Simulator](https://www.vincross.com/download-hexa-simulator) application so you can modify and control your HEXA from your computer.

You can use it as a sandbox for prototyping and designing new moves. 

HEXA Simulator is available for both Windows and macOS.

You can drag and drop shapes into the world to mimic obstacles that HEXA might encounter. Currently we support cubes, spheres, and capsule shapes. You can change the color, position, and coordinates of each shape as well as of the HEXA.
