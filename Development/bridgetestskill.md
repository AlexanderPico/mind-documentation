# Test Skill

Sometimes when you're testing a new Skill, you want to send it to a friend or colleague, but you don't want it to be public on the Skill Store just yet. That's what the Test Skill section is for. You can upload a Test Skill and generate a link that can be accessed by your collaborators. This way, they can try out the Skill and make comments without going through the rigorous Skill Store review process.

How to use Test Skill: 

1. Create and upload a Test Skill using 'Create Test Skill'. Upload the `.mpk` package to the Skill's details page. 

2. Each Test Skill will be assigned with a test link in the form of a QR code. When you're ready, select 'Turn on.'![](/assets/Screen Shot 2017-08-14 at 6.35.43 PM.png)

3. Anyone with the test link can view and install the Skill on their HEXA.

4. To update the Skill content, click "Edit Skill" button to upload a new package or edit the Skill description. 

5. If you want to stop sharing the test Skill, click the "Turn off" button, and the test link will no longer be accessable.
