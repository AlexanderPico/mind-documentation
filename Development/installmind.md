# Install the MIND SDK

To get started developing for HEXA, you'll need two things: A [HEXA robot](https://www.vincross.com/hexa) and the MIND SDK.

Depending on your platform, we have installation instructions on setting up the SDK, installing dependencies, and connecting with your HEXA robot. 

Choose your platform below:
