# HEXA's Legs

# Range of Motion

Each of HEXA's legs has a wide range of motion, which you can see defined in the diagrams below. In this diagram, the three joints are at 90, 90, and 45 degrees, respectively.

# Leg and Body Coordinates

The legs and body are tracked using a Cartesian coordinate system based on the diagrams below.

Additionally, the body-coordinates follow the direction of the camera, as opposed to the ground-coordinates. The ground-coordinates will not change when the camera rotates.
