# Publishing your Skills

We built HEXA with the spirit of sharing and community in mind. That means that you can share your Skills and applications with other HEXA owners online, and see what other people are creating as well. We want to build the most active, thriving community of robot enthusiasts on the internet.

Once you've created a [Skill](/Introduction/hexaskills.md), you can upload it to the [Skill Store](/Introduction/skillstore.md) or chat about it on our [Forums](/Introduction/forum.md). We might even give you a shout-out on [social media](/Introduction/socialmedia.md) :\)
