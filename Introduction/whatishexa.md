# What is HEXA?

Hello, Human! Say hi to HEXA.![](/assets/Screen Shot 2017-08-14 at 10.10.48 AM.png)

HEXA is a six-legged robot designed to handle all sorts of terrain. You can write programs \(called [Skills](/Introduction/hexaskills.md)\) to control HEXA and also control the robot by using your mobile device as a remote.

We like to think of HEXA as the "living being." It can dance, climb, cross gaps, crawl, and more.

Here are some of the features that HEXA provides:

* 3 axis accelerometer to stay balanced

* distance cameras to detect objects

* infrared sensor for night vision

You can find out more about HEXA's internals on our [Hardware](/Introduction/hardware.md) page.

We believe in an open robot for everyone to use and develop on. That's why HEXA is open source. You can find more information on our [GitHub](/Introduction/github.md). Check out our [development section](/Development/yourfirstskill.md) to learn how to create your first skills on HEXA.

HEXA runs on the [MIND OS](/Introduction/mindos.md), which is our Linux-based OS for robotics. This makes it easy for developers to customize HEXA.

We provide a thriving community of robot developers to help you build, test, and distribute your skills. This is accomplished through the [Developer Bridge](/Development/developerbridge.md) and the [HEXA Skill Store](/Introduction/skillstore.md).

The skill store functions like an "app store" for robot skills and here you can share your functions and try out skills that others have developed.
