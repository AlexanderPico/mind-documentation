# What can I do with HEXA?

What can HEXA do?

A lot of things, actually. Here are just a few examples us and our Human Mentors put together:

* [HEXA navigates an obstacle course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OQrAyfnBBo)
* [HEXA the bull \(follows the color red\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1Ybisn04so)
* [HEXA dances to a beat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBaB7I-Baa8)

We also have a library of [Example Skills](/Development/exampleskills.md) for you to get started with.

All you need is an idea, a [HEXA](http://www.vincross.com/hexa), and the [MIND SDK](/Introduction/mindsdk.md).
