# What can I do with HEXA?

What can HEXA do?

A lot of things, actually. Here are just a few examples us and our Human Mentors put together:

* [HEXA navigates an obstacle course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OQrAyfnBBo)
* [HEXA the bull \(follows the color red\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1Ybisn04so)
* [HEXA dances to a beat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBaB7I-Baa8)

We have a library of [Example Skills](/Development/exampleskills.md) for you to get started with.

All you need is an idea, a [HEXA](http://www.vincross.com/hexa), and the [MIND SDK](/Introduction/mindsdk.md).

You can find applications from other developers on the [Skill Store](/Introduction/skillstore.md), and even [publish your own](/Introduction/publishingskills.md) once you're ready.

## Features

### Hardware Control

The [Robot part](/Introduction/robot.md) of our SDK allows you to control the hardware on HEXA. The [MIND SDK](/Introduction/mindsdk.md) provides APIs to abstract common tasks \(such as moving the limbs\), but allows you as a developer complete control of the robot. We have functions at varying levels of granularity for this purpose. Robot code for the HEXA is written in the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/).

### Remote Control

The [Remote part](/Introduction/remote.md) of the [MIND SDK](/Introduction/mindsdk.md) is used for transmitting data between mobile devices and robots. It works over a local network as well as over the internet. The SDK will find the fastest path between your device and robot \(local or WiFi\) and establish a communication channel with a unified programming interface.

Remote applications are stored on your mobile device and are written in JavaScript.

### Multitasking

You can run multiple applications on the HEXA simultaneously without affecting other applications or hardware resources.
